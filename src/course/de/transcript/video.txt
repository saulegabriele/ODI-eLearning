What is open data?

Open data is data that anyone can access use and share. Data becomes accessible by being made available online. Data becomes usable by being made available in a common, understandable format. The most important thing is that data is licensed. This licence should allow for free reuse of the data, including for commercial purposes. 

What is data?

Think of data at the bottom of a three-tier triangle so you have got data, information and knowledge. Data is the lowest level of abstraction from which information and then knowledge are derived. Think of all the locations, pictures, reviews, descriptions and prices that you might need in order to plan a holiday for instance. You take all of this data and turn it into information about where you want to go and from that you contextualise it and turn it into knowledge that is relevant for you. At the same time someone else could take all that data and look at the differences in cost between activities across the country so a completely different usage. So its critical to have this data, so we can build all these different levels of information and allow people to contextualise them to build their own knowledge.

What makes data oepn?

Data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse and share it. This use must be without restiction. So if you apply a non-commercial licence on data, that is a restriction, so therefore it is no longer open. But although data is free to use and that is how it is measured - in its usage, its all about use - that does not necessarily mean it comes without cost. It might not be free to access. In order to maintain and sustain the availablility of this open data there may be some marginal cost. The common occurence is that this cost should be no more than the reasonable reproduction cost of the unit of data that someone is asking for. For something to be open data is all about how people can use it; it's not about how it is published and how it is made available, it is about what people can do with it once they have it. Thats what makes it open data.

Why do we need open data?

Open data has the power to transform the interaction between governments, businesses and society and this will unlock real value. New applications can be developed, problems can be solved and this will help generate real value for society, the economy and also solve some of the environmental issues. This is where it has already generated real impact, improving our transport infrastructure and saving countless lives. The web is already an accepted part of our societal infrastructure and open data is the next critical part of this infrastructure
